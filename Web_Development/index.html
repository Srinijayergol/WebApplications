      <p>Monday morning we drove to road to the sun from west glacier park to east glacier park. On the way there were many wonderful scenic spots. We got down from the car to take pictures and enjoy the nature. Along side of the road there were many water falls. Enjoyed the nature beauty.
      That day around 2 pm we saw a spot called lunch creek. This place was awesome. There was a creek and to our surprise this place had a trekking path. After careful observation this path lead to the mountain.
      Then, we slowly started taking the path and spoke with the people who were coming down from mountain cliff. These people started saying few things about the trek and it was a second surprise for us, they said they could see the mountain sheeps and mountain deers. We were so excited to see those mountain sheeps and mountain deers and we started our trek again
      We had almost lost the faith of seeing mountain sheeps and mountain deers as it was turning dark and we had to trek back. But at one sudden spot we saw a mountain sheeps then we ran to the spot to take the picture.
      And this spot was mind-blowing, beautiful flowers all over the landscape, small falls, in betwen mountain sheeps were gazing. Wow this place was wonderful.</p>
